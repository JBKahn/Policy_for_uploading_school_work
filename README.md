Policy_for_uploading_school_work
================================

It is considered an acadmeic offence to upload course work, however most proffessors do not resue assignments and as such it is not of any consequence that I upload these for the purpose of showing potential employers my coding style. However, if you see any assignemnt or work which you would like me to take down, I will gladly remove it.

This does not contain any course work I am activly working on.
